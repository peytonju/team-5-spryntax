## Project Description

**Communication:** Channels: Discord, Email, and Canvas. Fastest response time will be on discord with a time within 24 hours, with email being the next fastest, and canvas being the slowest. Of course there is an exception for emergencies 

**Abstract:** Coding requires a subset of characters not commonly used in normal typing. To name a few (\<, \>, :, ;, { }, \[ \], \-, \+, \=, //, \_ ) and programming languages have different syntaxes as well, therefore even more variety of characters you wouldn’t normally use. Traditional typing practice websites are useful for general typing but what about coding? Well, what if you were shown algorithms– in multiple programming languages that you can select– and had to type it out? Not only will you practice typing code, but you’ll learn more about the fundamentals of the particular programming language you selected, and also the functionality/structure of the algorithm via the algorithm itself and comments throughout the code. Additionally, there will be an educational guide explaining the algorithm in detail at the bottom of the typing section, so you can learn and grow your programming skills no matter what.

**Goal:** The primary goal of spryntax is to introduce beginner programmers to the way modern programming languages are typed and to important concepts used in computer science, as well inspiring competition in typing speed amongst programmers.

**Current practice:** Current practices include coding languages at a surface level of understanding and with varying degrees of realism and syntax.

**Novelty:** Existing practices have these algorithms but this project will go beyond that and showcase what the program does. Secondly, existing practices limit the coding time and this implementation will take a stopwatch approach to allow the user to code the full algorithm.

**Effects:** Will help novice programmers learn how to code while adding a little bit of competition. It will also aid programmers in learning other languages. 

**Use Cases (Functional Requirements):**

**Key:**

Minimum Viable Product Goals

- Monkeytype-style of program that allows users to type characters needed to create a specific file, the file contains some useful-to-know algorithm  
- Citations and extra resources provided for each assignment for further elaboration on each assignment  
- Explanation of the code that the user types (with comments)  
- Leaderboard for fastest times  
- Statistics for users  
  - Time that a user took on a specific assignment  
  - Words per minute (\# of chars divided by 5\)  
- OSU server hosts the site and contains all code within it

Stretch Goals

- “Profile” for a particular user that other users can view  
  - Support for multiple programming languages  
  - Support for users to compile/interpret code on the site

**Non-functional Requirements:** 

- User passwords are securely stored  
- A clean website that looks aesthetically pleasing  
- Multiple users can be actively on the server at the same time

**External Requirements:** 

- The product is a web-based service, the server must have a public URL that others can use to access it.   
- The product must be robust against errors that can reasonably be expected to occur, such as invalid user input.  
- If your project is a web-based server, you will need to provide instructions for someone else setting up a new server.   
- Your system should be well documented to enable new developers to make enhancements.  
- The scope of the project must match the resources (number of team members) assigned.

**Technical approach:**

- The project is web-based and will be using NodeJS for processing user inputs and sending that information to a .NET framework.

**Risks:** The biggest risk spryntax may face is handling how data is saved for every single user. There is a very large concern for a potential race condition towards saving data, which may result in data loss.

**Team info:**  

- **Kali Pulanco**  
  - Project Lead and UX \+ UI Lead/Implementation  
- **Shrey Bosamia**  
  - Full stack overall – specifically the Back-end and Database lead. Working with the Front-end team for javascript functionality on non-static user interactions.  
- **John Polasek**  
  - Login page developer, home page login  
- **Aidan Lusk**   
  - Backend, assisting  
- **Seojin Lee**  
  -   Will assist Leads
- **Prathmesh Nitin Gite**  
  -   Will assist Leads
- **Justice Peyton**  
  - Full stack – will work on frontend Javascript and backend functionalities and generally help in a variety of areas

**Timeline:**
