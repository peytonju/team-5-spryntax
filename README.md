### Team Communication 
#### Trello
The team will utilize Trello to communicate team-wide and individual expectations and deadlines.  
https://trello.com/b/4y3Ca40R/pt5spryntax
#### Discord
The team will primarily communicate over Discord to establish meeting times, general communication, and for urgent messages. The team is encouraged to check this at least every 24 hours. 
#### Outlook
Outlook will be minimally used by the team but may be utilized to formally reach out to TAs or Instructors. The team will also utilize Outlook for meeting information-- specifically where, when, and what will be discussed. In the case that Discord is not working, this will be used in its place as a primary method for communication. 
#### Canvas
Canvas will be used in case Discord or Outlook are both unavailable. The team may also reach to team members directly through Canvas announcements in case we are unable to reach them.

## Project Description
**Abstract:** Coding requires a subset of characters not commonly used in normal typing. To name a few (\<, \>, :, ;, { }, \[ \], \-, \+, \=, //, \_ ) and programming languages have different syntaxes as well, therefore even more variety of characters you wouldn’t normally use. Traditional typing practice websites are useful for general typing but what about coding? Well, what if you were shown algorithms– in multiple programming languages that you can select– and had to type it out? Not only will you practice typing code, but you’ll learn more about the fundamentals of the particular programming language you selected, and also the functionality/structure of the algorithm via the algorithm itself and comments throughout the code. Additionally, there will be an educational guide explaining the algorithm in detail at the bottom of the typing section, so you can learn and grow your programming skills no matter what.

**Goal:** The primary goal of spryntax is to introduce beginner programmers to the way modern programming languages are typed and to important concepts used in computer science, as well inspiring competition in typing speed amongst programmers.

**Current practice:** Current practices include coding languages at a surface level of understanding and with varying degrees of realism and syntax.

**Novelty:** Existing practices have these algorithms but this project will go beyond that and showcase what the program does. Secondly, existing practices limit the coding time and this implementation will take a stopwatch approach to allow the user to code the full algorithm.

**Effects:** Will help novice programmers learn how to code while adding a little bit of competition. It will also aid programmers in learning other languages. 

**Use Cases (Functional Requirements):**
Minimum Viable Product Goals:
- Monkeytype-style of program that allows users to type characters needed to create a specific file, the file contains some useful-to-know algorithm  
- Citations and extra resources provided for each assignment for further elaboration on each assignment  
- Explanation of the code that the user types (with comments)  
- Leaderboard for fastest times  
- Statistics for users  
  - Time that a user took on a specific assignment  
  - Words per minute (\# of chars divided by 5\)  
- Save user data in a databa as long as they are logged in

Stretch Goals:
- “Profile” for a particular user that other users can view  
  - Support for multiple programming languages  
  - Support for users to compile/interpret code on the site
- Allow users to favorite a level 
  


**Non-functional Requirements:** 
- User passwords are securely stored  
- A clean website that looks aesthetically pleasing  
- Multiple users can be actively on the server at the same time

**External Requirements:** 

- The product is a web-based service, the server must have a public URL that others can use to access it.   
- The product must be robust against errors that can reasonably be expected to occur, such as invalid user input.  
- If your project is a web-based server, you will need to provide instructions for someone else setting up a new server.   
- Your system should be well documented to enable new developers to make enhancements.  
- The scope of the project must match the resources (number of team members) assigned.

**Technical approach:** The project is web-based and will be using NodeJS for processing user inputs and sending that information to a .NET framework.

## Coding Guideline

### Overview
Following a standard for code is an incredibly important aspect of programming with a large team. We will constantly be referring to one another’s work and actively making changes to the project, perhaps on work that is not our own. Understanding what’s happening within the code is an imperative part of having a successful project. Below are several sections of languages that our project will utilize alongside the standards that they will follow. All team members are encouraged and expected to read and be familiar with the standards.

### Executed Languages
Executed languages are languages that we are actively using and working with to make our project work. Technically, all languages should be listed here– however, our project utilizes some code that does not actually get executed but is viewed by the users of our site. Since it is viewed by users, we must follow a strong and common standard since they will be directly viewed by people who seek to learn and get used to actual professional programming, which is why those languages are listed in their own section.

#### HTML
Style guide:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/HTML
HTML naturally lacks any sort of structure, making it very necessary for us to follow guidelines– especially for cross-browser compatibility. The MDN Web Docs provides many examples, explanations, and guidelines for how to use and write HTML. The MDN Web Docs were also referenced within the Web Development course here at OSU, making this a set of documents that every team member is familiar with.


## Process Description

### I. Risk assessment:
- **Overambition, unfinished project. (Risk: Low), (Impact: High)**. Currently, we are on track regarding the project timeline, but if we try to add in too many features we could fall behind. In the event we do fall behind we would be left with an unfinished website which would be a big issue. If we do begin falling behind we can reduce the scope of a project to a more manageable size. 
- **Crashing of the website. (Risk: Medium), (Impact: High)**. We are working on the infrastructure for the website now. In the event that a bug slips through our testing procedures, downtime on a website has a huge impact. Users are never happy with unexpected outages. We are working to reduce this risk by ensuring our testing is through. We can test this risk by testing if the website is live.
- **User Data Loss. (Risk: Low), (Impact: Medium)**. Our database is a MySQL server hosted by OSU IT. We are not hosting the server so it is possible for the server to be unexpectedly taken down or for it to be deleted. The OSU servers are generally live most of the time, and we have planned to have the server live with OSU IT until the end of the term. A test to check that the database still exists is checking if the MySQL server is live. We could mitigate risk by periodically creating saves of the database and storing it off the server.
- **Ensuring a Secure Website. (Risk: Medium), (Impact: High)**. We are planning to build as secure a website as we can. In the event that we do have a security issue then it could compromise user passwords, emails, or more. We will ensure that all of our applications are up to date as testing for bugs that could lead to a data breach. Detection for this risk is hard, but we are planning on logging who is accessing the database. In the event a security breach does occur, we will inform our users as soon as possible and try to ensure that a similar breach is unable to happen again.
- **Team Unavailability. (Risk: Low), (Impact: High)**. Team members may experience unexpected emergencies or become overwhelmed with their school workload. At the movement, we have found times when members can attend group meetings or at least attend digitally, but if issues arise in the future this could slow down our project. We can reduce the chance of this happening by having periodic check-ins and currently having clear lines of communication. If someone becomes unavailable then we can distribute their work among the team.
