### BETA TESTING User Documentation

#### Installing the software
Installation is not required-- you can visit our site at http://flip1.engr.oregonstate.edu:8080/.
- Please note that this is not accessible when off the OSU network. You are able to use an OSU VPN to alleviate this problem.  

If installation is something you do want to do, refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/peytonju/team-5-spryntax/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

- These will appear at the end of a line of code in the programming input once the user successfully types a line of code and will go away if the line of code becomes incorrect.
- Hovering over the object will show what that line of code does.
- Programming Page
  - On the programming page, the user can select an algorithm and language. As the user types in the program, each character is highlighted either blue or orange.
    - Blue indicates that the character is a correct match.
    - Orange indicates that the character is an incorrect match and should be replaced.
  - Once each character is highlighted blue, the results are shown below the input.
    - Time taken, which subtracts the current time from the time at the first input.
    - Errors, which are counted by every orange highlight that appears in the input.
    - Speed, which takes the number of characters of the selected algorithm in proportion to the time taken to type in the input.
  
#### Reporting bugs
The website will have a report bug button on each screen for the user to use if they encounter a bug. When the user uses the report bug button, they will be directed to a page where they will have to report what screen they were on when they encountered the bug, what the bug is and what it is affecting. The user will be asked to type out a short description of the bug on the report bug page. And when the user submits the bug report, it will then be stored in our database so that a member of our team can check it out and resolve the issue at a later date.
