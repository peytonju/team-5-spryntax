## Team Report

## Previous Plans and Goals

- Get Node.js and PM2 working on eng server to have the website running indefinitely 
- Get routes to the database table to have CRUD functionality. 
- Add data to the database
- Make data available to view on the website 
- Start building out the website in Node.js
    
### Progress and Issues

- Login in page and sign in page are in progress
- Added user route to database that stores user information that they put in the sign page and creates a user in the database
- Added functionality to hash password when use signs up to the database, making it secure

## Individual Contributions

### Kali Pulanco

- Add JS and JSON to load an algorithm.
  - Fix inputs.
  - Store separate variables for a “display string” and “comparison string”

### Shrey Bosamia

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Add routes to the database, giving the necessary CRUD functionality that the end-user would need for all the tables
- Add data to the database, such as the algorithm, difficulty, Data structures it’s used for, and Approach/techniques that the algorithm uses.
- Having the website read all the data at the very least (this is for testing if the routes work correctly)
- Have the user password be hashed in the database
- Start helping front-end with the implementation of the design layout (mainly HTML, and CSS)

### Justice Peyton

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Experiment with how to get Node Modules to work locally and on OSU’s servers and set it up for use by everybody– this is rather urgent
- Will begin making the C version of Bubble, Insertion, and Merge Sort, as well as Doubly-Linked and Singly-Linked lists.

#### Progress and Issues

- NodeJS and NPM was successfully implemented onto the OSU servers, specifically “flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu”
- Experimented with Express Handlebars, but it was decided for simplicity and the ease of use to just use raw HTML files instead
- I currently have our website being hosted on “flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu” on port 8080
- Made the C version of Bubble sort along with its comments
  - This will require JSONifying to be placed on the HTML

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Work with Kali on the JSONification of the algorithms and how it’ll be loaded onto the “playing the level” site
- Continue working on C versions for:
  - Mergesort  
  - Insertion sort
  - Singley linked lists
  - Doubley linked lists
