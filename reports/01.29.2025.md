## Team Report

### Previous Plans and Goals

- Backend  
  - Create a schema for our database, set up locally is OK  
- Frontend  
  - Progressing on site design  
  - Prototyping//wireframing the site

### Progress and Issues

- Prototype of character layering (where the user's inputs are placed over the words that they have to type)  
- Basic HTML and CSS implementation  
- Created schema for database and got an OSU server to host the MySQL database  
- Added connection to the database through database.js and .env file containing the sensitive information regarding the connection to the database

### Current Plans and Goals

- Get Node.js and PM2 working on eng server to have the website running indefinitely   
- Get routes to the database table to have CRUD functionality.   
- Add data to the database  
- Make data available to view on the website   
- Start building out the website in Node.js

## Individual Contributions

### Kali Pulanco

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Refine the prototype.  
  - Adjust the colors of the ghost layer so that the text contrasts under webAIM criteria.  
  - Include a space for settings.  
- Create a partial functional prototype that proves that the layering concept is feasible.

#### Progress and Issues

- Prototype (well, more of a proof of concept) works for the character layering.  
  - Some inputs (tabs and newlines) work differently in a text input.  
  - \<, newlines, and tabs in an algorithm require special html input to be displayed.  
  - Character validation checking requires a lot of \<span\>.  
- File hierarchy doesn’t disambiguate the .css file, breaking if there’s ambiguity.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Add JS and JSON to load an algorithm.  
  - Fix inputs.  
  - Store separate variables for a “display string” and “comparison string”  
    - Display string puts every character into a span.  
      - Check if the span character matches.  
    - Validate if the character matches.

### Shrey Bosamia

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Create database schema.  
- Finish completing MySQL database with localhost, and importing that to either the OSU server or AWS server (depending on whether we get an OSU server database).  
- Presenting our project in class.  
- Work on backend routes to the database.

#### Progress and Issues

- Finished database schema  
- We got an OSU server for MySQL, so imported mysql dump into the server  
- Added folder structure to GitHub repo such as a bin, config, public, app, controllers, models, routes, test) which makes it more organized and scalable.  
- Added database.js to the config folder containing the connection to the database and added sensitive information to the .env in the root directory 

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Add routes to the database, giving the necessary CRUD functionality that the end-user would need for all the tables  
- Add data to the database, such as the algorithm, difficulty, Data structures it’s used for, and Approach/techniques that the algorithm uses.  
- Having the website read all the data at the very least (this is for testing if the routes work correctly)  
- Have the user password be hashed in the database  
- Start helping front-end with the implementation of the design layout (mainly HTML, and CSS)

### Seojin Lee

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Wait for the database to be finalized to start on the code of the database functionalities  
- Continue researching for database functions  
- Look into AWS or MySql depending on what method is going to be used

#### Progress and Issues

- Started to copy down algorithms and explanations into the SQL database for python  
- Was in the discussions during the group meeting  
- Starting using git push and trello for progress report  
- Research more about potential backend functions to implement

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Possibly start working on the backend code of the project  
- Copy down algorithms and explanations into the SQL database

### Prathmesh Nitin Gite

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Started working on the Javascript Backend. 
- Presented our project in class.  
- Gonna change case if we couldn’t get the SQL sever from the ENGR IT Team

#### Progress and Issues

- Worked on the backend routes to the database.
- Started working on Leaderboard page for adding the buttons.
- Started working on the PHP admin server provided by the ENGR IT Team.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Going to add the buttons on the webiste pages.
- Going to complete adding buttons and format for the leaderboard page.

### Justice Peyton

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Still planning to familiarize myself with SQL  
- Meeting with Shrey to discuss how SQL works and how we’ll be using it in the project

#### Progress and Issues

- I haven’t had progress with SQL, but I will attempt to contribute in other areas  
- Experimented with Node Modules and specifically Handlebars to modularize front-end development  
  - Express is difficult to use on OSU’s servers since Express starts a local process that is inaccessible to outsiders  
  - Browserify is a potential option to convert node modules into client-side javascript  
- Currently working on JSONifying levels so that we can modularly load and unload levels and their relevant information

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Experiment with how to get Node Modules to work locally and on OSU’s servers and set it up for use by everybody– this is rather urgent  
- Will begin making the C version of Bubble, Insertion, and Merge Sort, as well as Doubly-Linked and Singly-Linked lists.

### John Harrison Polasek

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Build out front end plan (do we require users to login and sign up)  
- Acquire MySQL server or adequate alternative

#### Progress and Issues

- Acquired a MySQL server through OSU IT  
- Attended team meeting to build out front end

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Begin a creating a login and sign up page  
- Help with an auto hotkey setup in following weeks

### Aidan Lusk

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Create database functionality
- Successfully present our ideas to the class

#### Progress and Issues

- Database created
- Ideas presented to the class successfully
- Start using github and trello to better communicate our progress
- Better communication of ideas and understanding of the scope of the project

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Put in our code sets and explanations into the database
- Further work on the database
