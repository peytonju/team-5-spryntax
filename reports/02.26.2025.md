#### Previous Plans and Goals
- OSU Node Server  
  - If this doesn’t work out, the team should consider either attempting to use AWS or simply force ourselves to use outdated versions of Node and NPM on our local machines to ensure what we do is actually reflected on the OSU server  
- CircleCI  
  - Will do some research on how we can actually use this for “building” our site  
- Finish the attributes of levels and hopefully finish the searching algorithm
#### Progress and Issues
- OSU CoE IT has updated Node and NPM on flip1  
- Will develop some tests on CircleCI for the JSONifier, primarily sanity checks to see if lines are properly parsed  
  - The OSU servers still parse files a little differently with “fs” than when hosted locally on someone’s machine, however this has a simple fix  
- Level attributes were complete, only two exist and are displayed on the level\_select page  
- Deleted SQL-related level code, all level data will be stored on the Express server rather than the SQL server  
  - SQL server will know, however, what levels do exist, ex: bubble sort, merge sort, etc
#### Current Plans and Goals
- Planning on helping Kali with the code comments as needed  
  - The storage of the code comments has not been strictly tested, so we may come across an issue with it  
- Planning on creating description pages for each algorithm, all of which will be available to visit on the main page of the site
