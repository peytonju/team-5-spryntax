#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Finish CSS for every page. Since I pretty much got the theme down, I have to just match that with every page making it easier since I won’t have to spend time with creativity or learning new CSS features  
- Add a tilting functionality to our cards, making it seem more 3D-like  
- Help with the backend integration of the leaderboard, favorites, and stats page. This is the last part that we need to finish, and we should be across the finish line in terms of our 7 use cases for this class

#### Progress and Issues

- Finished the model and controller aspect of the stats page so that the data from the stats table in the database gets dynamically loaded into stats page  
- Added navigation to every page  
- Finished CSS for the header for every page  
- Finished favorites functionality   
  - The user can favorite a level in the level select page only if logged in, and that will be displayed on the favorites page, which will show all of the favorites of the user  
  - The user can unfavorite a level in the level select page or the favorites page, which will remove that favorite from the database and, as a result, remove it from the favorites page  
  - The buttons turn from favorite to unfavorite and vice versa, so the user only has the option of favoriting each level once, which makes it impossible for duplicate favorites of the same level  
  - The favorites page shows “Log in or sign up to have favorites” if the user isn’t logged in  
  - The favorites page shows “No favorites” if the user is logged in but doesn’t have any favorites  
  - If a user isn’t logged in and tries to favorite a level, a pop-up showing “error: User needs to be signed in to favorite” will show

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Finish CSS for these:  
  - The main page (Have to wait until explanations are added)  
  - The leaderboard, stats, and About Us page once they’re done  
  - Each individual level that’s available for the user   
- Help with stats and the leaderboard page if help is needed.  
- Add additional functionality if time allows it. Some features could be tracking accuracy, or having the users' progress tracked (User finishing a level will be tracked so the user can see which levels they have taken)

### Justice Peyton
#### Previous Plans and Goals
- OSU Node Server  
  - If this doesn’t work out, the team should consider either attempting to use AWS or simply force ourselves to use outdated versions of Node and NPM on our local machines to ensure what we do is actually reflected on the OSU server  
- CircleCI  
  - Will do some research on how we can actually use this for “building” our site  
- Finish the attributes of levels and hopefully finish the searching algorithm
#### Progress and Issues
- OSU CoE IT has updated Node and NPM on flip1  
- Will develop some tests on CircleCI for the JSONifier, primarily sanity checks to see if lines are properly parsed  
  - The OSU servers still parse files a little differently with “fs” than when hosted locally on someone’s machine, however this has a simple fix  
- Level attributes were complete, only two exist and are displayed on the level\_select page  
- Deleted SQL-related level code, all level data will be stored on the Express server rather than the SQL server  
  - SQL server will know, however, what levels do exist, ex: bubble sort, merge sort, etc
#### Current Plans and Goals
- Planning on helping Kali with the code comments as needed  
  - The storage of the code comments has not been strictly tested, so we may come across an issue with it  
- Planning on creating description pages for each algorithm, all of which will be available to visit on the main page of the site
