### Shrey Bosamia

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Work with John to test if the registration and login page correctly creates and reads from the user table in the database. Also adding passwording hashing   
- Make it so the algorithms are dynamically loaded in the browse algorithms page  
- If the typing portion is nearly complete, work with frontend to collect stats from the user session, and create appropriate routes to the database to save that information  
- Work on the favorites microservice

#### Progress and Issues

- Login page and sign up page sends data and reads data from database  
- The algorithms are now dynamically loaded in the level\_select (browse algorithms) page  
- Fixed algorithm.js in models to correctly select from the algorithm table in our database  
- Fixed the algorithmController to correctly send data to level\_select.ejs for the algorithms to be dynamically loaded  
- Moved spryntax.js (Which holds our routes and starts the server) to root directory along with the public directory, and removed our routes directory inside the app directory since all of our routes are in spryntax.js   
  - I updated all the routes to match our the new orders of all the directories

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Will work on adding the filtering functionality, so the user can filter the algorithm by difficulty, data structure, and approach  
- Work on the CSS of the entire website, making sure all pages have a matching theme of our color scheme  
- Create the pages and add the routes for the pages we haven’t added yet, (So favorites, leaderboard, User stats)

### Justice Peyton

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Work with Kali on the JSONification of the algorithms and how it’ll be loaded onto the “playing the level” site  
- Continue working on C versions for:  
  - Mergesort  
  - Insertion sort  
  - Singley linked lists  
  - Doubley linked lists

#### Progress and Issues

- Other team members completed the C and Python versions for our project  
- Made a simple JSONifier for every algorithm we have. This is a static build tool that we will build and have in the Public directory of our website.  
  - This JSONifier scans every Python and C file we have under a certain directory and appends their lines into another JSON. The format is as specified below:  
    - {category: {language: {lines: “”, comments: \[\]}}}  
  - Example below.  
    - { bubblesort: {   
      	c: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] },   
      	py: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] }   
      },   
      mergesort: {   
      	c: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] },   
      	py: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] }   
      },   
      slink: {   
      	c: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] },   
      	py: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] }   
      }}  
  - “lines” is literally a massive string of every single line of the file. These lack comments and will be what the user types on our site.  
  - “comments” is a collection of every single comment of the file in the form of a JSON. Given some arbitrary comment, that comment will be assigned to whatever line number that it’s a comment for.  
    - For example, if some comment is for line 1, it will be assigned to the index of Line 1 in the “lines” array. You can simply directly query this JSON with that index (ex: comments\[0\] will give you the comment for index 0 of the lines array).

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Further develop the JSONifier and modify it as needed to work with Kali’s work on the typing section of our site  
  - This may require some editing to the “lines” string to ensure that certain characters are replaced with legal ones, such as the carriage return and tab symbol that Kali is using  
- Will begin work on the backend of the searching for specific algorithms for use by frontend  
  - This utilizes the JSON that’s created by the JSONifier
