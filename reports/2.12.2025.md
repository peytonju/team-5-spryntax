#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Work with John to test if the registration and login page correctly creates and reads from the user table in the database. Also adding passwording hashing   
- Make it so the algorithms are dynamically loaded in the browse algorithms page  
- If the typing portion is nearly complete, work with frontend to collect stats from the user session, and create appropriate routes to the database to save that information  
- Work on the favorites microservice

#### Progress and Issues

- Login page and sign up page sends data and reads data from database  
- The algorithms are now dynamically loaded in the level\_select (browse algorithms) page  
- Fixed algorithm.js in models to correctly select from the algorithm table in our database  
- Fixed the algorithmController to correctly send data to level\_select.ejs for the algorithms to be dynamically loaded  
- Moved spryntax.js (Which holds our routes and starts the server) to root directory along with the public directory, and removed our routes directory inside the app directory since all of our routes are in spryntax.js   
  - I updated all the routes to match our the new orders of all the directories

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Will work on adding the filtering functionality, so the user can filter the algorithm by difficulty, data structure, and approach  
- Work on the CSS of the entire website, making sure all pages have a matching theme of our color scheme  
- Create the pages and add the routes for the pages we havenâ€™t added yet, (So favorites, leaderboard, User stats)
