## Contributions of Individual Team Members
### Kali Pulanco
#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Remove extra newlines from being a mistake.
- Sync JSON with typing interface.
- Divide the typing program into lines.
- Add user comments as a circled lowercase i at the end of a line that needs information.
- Add inline comments explaining the loops and conditionals.

#### Progress and Issues

- JSON files of code are synced with the interface
  - There may be hidden “Tab” inputs causing errors on otherwise blank lines
    - Would be fixed on the JSON side by next week.
    - “Tab” class will have a tab indicator by next week.
- Circled lowercase i is not compatible with the inconsolata font, making the formatting disjointed.
  - Changed plan with “(?)” as a comment that opens. (Not yet implemented)
- Changed span colors to function as an underline instead of a highlight for usability.
- Added WPM and CPS calculations on completions.
- Adjusted styling to have a centered max width of 1080p.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Change tab spans to indicate that a tab should be there.
- Prevent newlines from being counted as a mistake.
- Set a flag to find if pasting was used during the process.
- Implement tooltips for comments.

### Shrey Bosamia
#### Previous Plans and Goals

- I will work on adding the filtering functionality, so the user can filter the algorithm by difficulty, data structure, and approach  
- Work on the CSS of the entire website, making sure all pages have a matching theme of our color scheme  
- Create the pages and add the routes for the pages we haven’t added yet, (So favorites, leaderboard, User stats)

#### Progress and Issues

- Changes in roles:  
  - Filtering functionality has moved to Justice’s role  
  - Creating the pages has moved to Prathmesh’s role  
- Worked on the CSS for the filter page, added cards that are dynamically put in a grid, and structured the look by using different background colors for each integral part  
- Added moving CSS elements within the border of one of the backgrounds making it significantly more polished and professional

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Finish CSS for every page. Since I pretty much got the theme down, I have to just match that with every page making it easier since I won’t have to spend time with creativity or learning new CSS features  
- Add a tilting functionality to our cards, making it seem more 3D-like  
- Help with the backend integration of the leaderboard, favorites, and stats page. This is the last part that we need to finish, and we should be across the finish line in terms of our 7 use cases for this class

### Seojin Lee
#### Previous Plans and Goals
- Going to ask the group what functionalities I should work on next
  - Most likely will be user stats or leaderboard
  - Also maybe help out on the css
  - I am not even sure if I can work on the user stats or leaderboard as Kali and Justice are still working on the typing functionality which is needed to track user stats
- Start coding the user stats or leaderboard or anything else that the group wants

#### Progress and Issues
- Helped out on the project implementation document assignment
- Helped update our readme / updated our use cases section
- Worked on the report button of the website
  - Made the html page
  - Started to work on the functionality of the report button
  - Made a report section in the database (may change later)
- Worked out what functionalities I am working on after discussing with the group

#### Current Plans and Goals
- Finish the report page/ button functionality
- Start working on the leaderboard page of the website
- Start helping the group with the test integration assignment

### Prathmesh Nitin Gite
#### Previous Plans and Goals
- Trying to complete stats webpage and adding the table for stats webpage to get the data from the PHP admin.
- Going to add a couple of more algorithms in the level select for the user.
- Adding the data in the jsonifier and extra.js for the levels to show on the webpage.

#### Progress and Issues
- Added the stats table to the PHP admin server.
- Added Heap Sort, Depth First Search, and Pattern algorithms in the alg folders in both C and Python languages.
- Then added the respective algorithms in the extra.js and jsonifier.js files.

#### Current Plans and Goals
- Going to help with the leaderboard page.
- Going to add some more algorithms for the level selcet page.
- Going to add the buttons on the index page.

### Justice Peyton
#### Previous Plans and Goals
- Further develop the JSONifier and modify it as needed to work with Kali’s work on the typing section of our site  
  - This may require some editing to the “lines” string to ensure that certain characters are replaced with legal ones, such as the carriage return and tab symbol that Kali is using  
- Will begin work on the backend of the searching for specific algorithms for use by frontend  
  - This utilizes the JSON that’s created by the JSONifier

#### Progress and Issues
- JSONifier is deemed finished and I will work on another section of the JSON-representation of levels by adding searchable criteria  
  - This “searchable criteria” includes:  
    - type of code in question  
      - sorting algorithm  
      - data structure  
    - difficulty  
      - easy  
      - medium  
      - hard  
    - …more may be added to make the search criteria more specific, but as of right now I don’t think it really needs to be any more complicated since we don’t have very many algorithms for it to be truly useful and unnecessarily verbose  
- Will develop the algorithm for searching based on what’s made above  
- OSU Server & Localhost Differences  
  - The OSU servers do not reflect the exact same things as localhost does on our site (some parts look visually different)  
    - This is because the OSU servers use a very outdated version of Node and Node Package Manager, meaning that some luxuries and formatting we have with the modern versions of Node and NPM aren’t on the OSU servers  
  - Due to the old version of Node and NPM on the OSU servers, I contacted OSU CoE IT to try to obtain a private server for our team that has a modern version of Node and NPM.  
- Created a CircleCI account and gave it permissions to our GitHub repository  
- Redid parts of our README’s Goal, Novelty, and Current Practice, as well as adding my own use case for Code Comments

#### Current Plans and Goals
- OSU Node Server  
  - If this doesn’t work out, the team should consider either attempting to use AWS or simply force ourselves to use outdated versions of Node and NPM on our local machines to ensure what we do is actually reflected on the OSU server  
- CircleCI  
  - Will do some research on how we can actually use this for “building” our site  
- Finish the attributes of levels and hopefully finish the sorting algorithm

### John Harrison Polasek
#### Previous Plans and Goals
- Work on getting buttons to new tabs such as login, sign up, leaderboard  
- Have a fully completed to present to the group for feedback and then testing

#### Progress and Issues
- Completed login and sign in pages  
  - Creates account and stores in the database  
  - Accounts must have unique usernames  
  - Sign in requires a existing email and password to exist in the database to log in  
- Changed from working on navigation to working on getting sessions working

#### Current Plans and Goals
- Get sessions working on the website or get assistance from team members to due so  
- Start working on testing 

### Aidan Lusk

- Speak with Shrey on how to improve on the database and back end functions
#### Progress and Issues
- Worked on the presentation
- Helped work on design documents
#### Current Plans and Goals
- Start working on the leaderboard page of the website
- I would like to find a new niche in the project
