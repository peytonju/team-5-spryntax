#### Previous Plans and Goals
- Further develop the JSONifier and modify it as needed to work with Kali’s work on the typing section of our site  
  - This may require some editing to the “lines” string to ensure that certain characters are replaced with legal ones, such as the carriage return and tab symbol that Kali is using  
- Will begin work on the backend of the searching for specific algorithms for use by frontend  
  - This utilizes the JSON that’s created by the JSONifier

#### Progress and Issues
- JSONifier is deemed finished and I will work on another section of the JSON-representation of levels by adding searchable criteria  
  - This “searchable criteria” includes:  
    - type of code in question  
      - sorting algorithm  
      - data structure  
    - difficulty  
      - easy  
      - medium  
      - hard  
    - …more may be added to make the search criteria more specific, but as of right now I don’t think it really needs to be any more complicated since we don’t have very many algorithms for it to be truly useful and unnecessarily verbose  
- Will develop the algorithm for searching based on what’s made above  
- OSU Server & Localhost Differences  
  - The OSU servers do not reflect the exact same things as localhost does on our site (some parts look visually different)  
    - This is because the OSU servers use a very outdated version of Node and Node Package Manager, meaning that some luxuries and formatting we have with the modern versions of Node and NPM aren’t on the OSU servers  
  - Due to the old version of Node and NPM on the OSU servers, I contacted OSU CoE IT to try to obtain a private server for our team that has a modern version of Node and NPM.  
- Created a CircleCI account and gave it permissions to our GitHub repository  
- Redid parts of our README’s Goal, Novelty, and Current Practice, as well as adding my own use case for Code Comments

#### Current Plans and Goals
- OSU Node Server  
  - If this doesn’t work out, the team should consider either attempting to use AWS or simply force ourselves to use outdated versions of Node and NPM on our local machines to ensure what we do is actually reflected on the OSU server  
- CircleCI  
  - Will do some research on how we can actually use this for “building” our site  
- Finish the attributes of levels and hopefully finish the sorting algorithm

### John Harrison Polasek
#### Previous Plans and Goals
- Work on getting buttons to new tabs such as login, sign up, leaderboard  
- Have a fully completed to present to the group for feedback and then testing

#### Progress and Issues
- Completed login and sign in pages  
  - Creates account and stores in the database  
  - Accounts must have unique usernames  
  - Sign in requires a existing email and password to exist in the database to log in  
- Changed from working on navigation to working on getting sessions working

#### Current Plans and Goals
- Get sessions working on the website or get assistance from team members to due so  
- Start working on testing
