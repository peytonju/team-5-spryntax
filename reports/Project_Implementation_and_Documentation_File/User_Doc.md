### User Documentation

#### High-level description

First the user must navigate to the site which will be publicly listed. When a user goes to the main page we will have a short description of the website, give users an option to log in, and a menu page. The user then can select a coding language and an algorithm that they wish to type and begin. This will record their time, accuracy, and calculate their typing speed. If the user is logged in their data will be saved and will be uploaded to a leaderboard. Users will want to use this website as it will improve their coding ability and provide a fun way to learn how to code. We will have 2 programming languages for a user to choose from and several algorithms for the user to choose from.
