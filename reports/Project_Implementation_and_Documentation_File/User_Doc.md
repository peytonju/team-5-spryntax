### User Documentation

#### High-level description

First the user must navigate to the site which will be publicly listed. When a user goes to the main page we will have a short description of the website, give users an option to log in, and a menu page. The user then can select a coding language and an algorithm that they wish to type and begin. This will record their time, accuracy, and calculate their typing speed. If the user is logged in their data will be saved and will be uploaded to a leaderboard. Users will want to use this website as it will improve their coding ability and provide a fun way to learn how to code. We will have 2 programming languages for a user to choose from and several algorithms for the user to choose from.

#### Reporting bugs
The website will have a report bug button on each screen for the user to use if they encounter a bug. When the user uses the report bug button, they will be directed to a page where they will have to report what screen they were on when they encountered the bug, what the bug is and what it is affecting. The user will be asked to type out a short description of the bug on the report bug page. And when the user submits the bug report, it will then be stored in our database so that a member of our team can check it out and resolve the issue at a later date.

#### Known bugs
Known bugs will be tracked in our database, whether via user report or by a team member, and the website will let the user know of these bugs if the known bug affects the usability of the website. Any bugs that are in the database will be addressed by a team member as quickly as possible especially if that bug affects the usability of the website. Trivial bugs will be dealt with in a quick manner as trivial bugs should be a quick fix.
