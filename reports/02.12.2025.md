## Individual Contributions

### Kali Pulanco

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Revert back to a non-handlebars system.
- Fix tab and enter inputs
  - Separate <span> tags by lines.
  - Divide the comparison string into an array of each line for comparison.

#### Progress and Issues

- Tabs and newlines are now registered in the typing interface.
- Singular string checking now works.
- Handlebars are now based on default HTML and JS.
- Added statistics for timing and mistakes.
- Added a faint drop shadow around the typing text to provide contrast on typed letters.
- Backspacing on an incorrect character now removes the incorrect tag on that character.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Remove extra newlines from being a mistake.
- Sync JSON with typing interface.
- Divide the typing program into lines.
- Add user comments as a circled lowercase i at the end of a line that needs information.
- Add inline comments explaining the loops and conditionals.

### Shrey Bosamia

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Work with John to test if the registration and login page correctly creates and reads from the user table in the database. Also adding passwording hashing   
- Make it so the algorithms are dynamically loaded in the browse algorithms page  
- If the typing portion is nearly complete, work with frontend to collect stats from the user session, and create appropriate routes to the database to save that information  
- Work on the favorites microservice

#### Progress and Issues

- Login page and sign up page sends data and reads data from database  
- The algorithms are now dynamically loaded in the level\_select (browse algorithms) page  
- Fixed algorithm.js in models to correctly select from the algorithm table in our database  
- Fixed the algorithmController to correctly send data to level\_select.ejs for the algorithms to be dynamically loaded  
- Moved spryntax.js (Which holds our routes and starts the server) to root directory along with the public directory, and removed our routes directory inside the app directory since all of our routes are in spryntax.js   
  - I updated all the routes to match our the new orders of all the directories

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Will work on adding the filtering functionality, so the user can filter the algorithm by difficulty, data structure, and approach  
- Work on the CSS of the entire website, making sure all pages have a matching theme of our color scheme  
- Create the pages and add the routes for the pages we haven’t added yet, (So favorites, leaderboard, User stats)
  
### Seojin Lee

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Help and finish out the midterm slides
- Possibly work on the users stats page
- Think of ideas that I can implement into the website

#### Progress and Issues

- Finished copying down the python section of the algorithms
  - Copied down all of the algorithms in python language (bubble, merge, insertion, singly, doubly, queue, stack)
  - Put down the information in a md file on github
  - Justice took that and made it into json files (the md file might have been deleted in the process)
- Helped finish out the midterm slides and presented the timeline section
- I am kind of lost on what I should be doing next as everything is moving very fast at least things related to coding the website

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Going to ask the group what functionalities I should work on next
  - Most likely will be user stats or leaderboard
  - Also maybe help out on the css
  - I am not even sure if I can work on the user stats or leaderboard as Kali and Justice are still working on the typing functionality which is needed to track user stats
- Start coding the user stats or leaderboard or anything else that the group wants

### Prathmesh Nitin Gite

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Completed the midterm presentation.
- Completed the speech that I made for the Potential Risks and Unit Tests.

#### Progress and Issues

- Summarized the speech cause it was going over the time limit of 10 minutes.
- Started working on the stats page.
- Started working on creating a database table for stats webpage.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Trying to complete 

### Justice Peyton

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Work with Kali on the JSONification of the algorithms and how it’ll be loaded onto the “playing the level” site  
- Continue working on C versions for:  
  - Mergesort  
  - Insertion sort  
  - Singley linked lists  
  - Doubley linked lists

#### Progress and Issues

- Other team members completed the C and Python versions for our project  
- Made a simple JSONifier for every algorithm we have. This is a static build tool that we will build and have in the Public directory of our website.  
  - This JSONifier scans every Python and C file we have under a certain directory and appends their lines into another JSON. The format is as specified below:  
    - {category: {language: {lines: “”, comments: \[\]}}}  
  - Example below.  
    - { bubblesort: {   
      	c: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] },   
      	py: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] }   
      },   
      mergesort: {   
      	c: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] },   
      	py: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] }   
      },   
      slink: {   
      	c: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] },   
      	py: { lines: \[String\], comments: \[Object\] }   
      }}  
  - “lines” is literally a massive string of every single line of the file. These lack comments and will be what the user types on our site.  
  - “comments” is a collection of every single comment of the file in the form of a JSON. Given some arbitrary comment, that comment will be assigned to whatever line number that it’s a comment for.  
    - For example, if some comment is for line 1, it will be assigned to the index of Line 1 in the “lines” array. You can simply directly query this JSON with that index (ex: comments\[0\] will give you the comment for index 0 of the lines array).

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Further develop the JSONifier and modify it as needed to work with Kali’s work on the typing section of our site  
  - This may require some editing to the “lines” string to ensure that certain characters are replaced with legal ones, such as the carriage return and tab symbol that Kali is using  
- Will begin work on the backend of the searching for specific algorithms for use by frontend  
  - This utilizes the JSON that’s created by the JSONifier

### John Harrison Polasek

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Work on getting buttons to new tabs such as login, sign up, leaderboard
- Continuation of login and sign up page

#### Progress and Issues

- Sign up page working, it now is able to connect to the database and create users. 
- Due to midterms this week I was unable to get as much work as I would have liked to get done, but will be more available for the next week

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Work on getting buttons to new tabs such as login, sign up, leaderboard
- Have a fully completed to present to the group for feed back and then testing

### Aidan Lusk

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Put in our code sets and explanations into the database
- Further work on the database
- Work on backend code for the project

#### Progress and Issues

- Helped work on slides and presentation
- Helped present a little
- Finished copying down c language into our database.
  - Copied down all of the algorithms in C language (bubble, merge, insertion, singly, doubly, queue, stack)
  - Put down the information in a md file on github
  - Justice took that and made it into json files

#### Current Plans and Goals

- I would like to find a new niche in the project that I can help on
- Speak with Shrey on how to improve on the database and back end functions
