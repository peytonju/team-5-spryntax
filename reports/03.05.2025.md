## Contributions of Individual Team Members
### Kali Pulanco

#### Previous Plans and Goals
- Send the typing data to the server and databases.
  - Create a separate object to be sent to the server/database for processing.
- Automatically adjust font size if the spans wrap.

#### Progress and Issues
- Data is now sent to the user data on completion.
- Refactored .ejs files.
  - Ended up breaking some things but were fixed right before the beta test.
- Added comment functionality at the end of a completed line.
- Added tooltips (hover titles) to the navigation bar to expand on what the individual option does.
- Link references on the favorites screen and stats screen if the user is not logged in.

#### Current Plans and Goals
- Hide debugging features from the user.
- Disable autocorrect in the typing input.
- Fix the bug where backspacing on an incorrect input doesn’t remove “correct” styling.

### Shrey Bosamia
#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Finish CSS for these:  
  - The main page (Have to wait until explanations are added)  
  - The leaderboard, stats, and About Us page once they’re done  
  - Each individual level that’s available for the user   
- Help with stats and the leaderboard page if help is needed.  
- Add additional functionality if time allows it. Some features could be tracking accuracy or having the users' progress tracked (User finishing a level will be tracked so the user can see which levels they have taken)

#### Progress and Issues

- Heatmap for the stats page that will track the user's progress throughout the past year of the current development   
- Graph for the stats page with the time of when the level was completed on the x-axis, and the y-axis is the wpm.   
  - There is an average of 10 levels and an average of 100 levels buttons that show the line of those averages. These buttons can be toggled on and off as the user pleases. The color of the lines of those averages match the color of the buttons respectfully.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Fixed bug in the stats page that wouldn’t load the page if the user is logged in to a new account without any stats.  
- CSS for the login and sign up page.
