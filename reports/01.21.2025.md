# 2025 01 21 Report

## Team Report

### Previous Plans and Goals

- Continue to familiarize ourselves with each other and designate succinct roles to people  
- Continue to discuss technical aspects of the project that we may need to spend significant time into  
- Figure out where we will host our application (AWS, OSU’s servers)

### Progress and Issues

- Team met with the TA on 1/17/2025 in Bexel 332 at 9:15 AM  
  - Team went over our entire project idea with the TA, all seems OK  
  - TA suggested a few things  
    - Potentially add a use case for two languages for our project  
    - Add a stretch goal of adding one or more languages on top of the two languages  
    - If we do use AWS, that’s a use case  
    - Slideshow should sell our project– should focus on an abstract overview of what we plan to do  
    - Slideshow should show our project timeline and overall should follow the flow of our ReadMe on GitHub  
- Ticket with OSU IT is progressing to get SQL access on OSU’s servers

### Current Plans and Goals

- Backend  
  - Create tables for our database, set up locally is OK, until we get the OSU server
  - Start adding data to the database
  - Start working on database connection and making routes to database tables  
- Frontend  
  - Progressing on site design  
  - Prototyping//wireframing the site
  - Color theme for the website

## Individual Contributions

### Kali Pulanco

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Create a non-functional prototype of the interface for A/B testing internally to establish a design for the project.

#### Progress and Issues

- Prototype has been made.  
- Prototype has been tested.  
  - Result is to have a typing layer in front of a ghost layer showing what needs to be typed.  
- Prototype doesn’t include a space for settings.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Refine the prototype.  
  - Adjust the colors of the ghost layer so that the text contrasts under webAIM criteria.  
  - Include a space for settings.  
- Create a partial functional prototype that proves that the layering concept is feasible.

### Shrey Bosamia

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Work on entity relationship diagram to give a blueprint for what the database will be, also giving others a good representation of what we are going to implement.  
- Work on setting up an AWS cloud database server in case we don’t get a server from the OSU engineering department

#### Progress and Issues

- Finished entity relationship diagram, and added new functionality.  
- Gave the idea of “favorites” functionality.  
- Gave the idea of “completed algorithms.”  
- Made more specifics for what should be in the leaderboard, user, session, and algorithm tables for our database.  
- Helped with the last slide for our presentation.  
- Made an AWS cloud database just in case we don’t get the OSU server.  
- Helped Kali and Justice with this Project Report.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Create database schema.  
- Finish completing MySQL database with localhost, and importing that to either the OSU server or AWS server (depending on whether we get an OSU server database).  
- Presenting our project in class.  
- Work on backend routes to the database.

### Seojin Lee

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Work on the project proposal slides for next week  
- Think of ideas related to the database and research potential functions

#### Progress and Issues

- Finished the project proposal slides for the presentation this week  
- Through the meetings, gained a better understanding of the database and its usage in the project  
- Talked about using AWS or MySql during the meetings  
- Brainstormed how the functionalities may be implemented in code for later

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Wait for the database to be finalized to start on the code of the database functionalities  
- Continue researching for database functions  
- Look into AWS or MySql depending on what method is going to be used

### Prathmesh Nitin Gite

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Assisted in preparing project proposal slides for the upcoming presentation.  
- Pitched the project idea to the TA during a scheduled session.  
- Brainstormed potential future use cases to enhance the project's scope.

#### Progress and Issues

- Went to the ENGR IT team for the SQL Server.  
- I started brainstorming for the backend Javascript and how to make it better  
- Attended the group meeting to come up with some efficient design

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Going to start working on the Javascript Backend  
- Presenting our project in class.  
- Gonna change case if we couldn’t get the SQL sever from the ENGR IT Team

### Justice Peyton

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Familiarize myself with SQL

#### Progress and Issues

- Did not progress significantly with SQL since I was occupied with other classes, but regardless this is still a major concern for me to contribute to the project  
- Went over several parts of the Living Document and revised and added information, including  
  - Project timeline  
  - Communication  
  - Risks  
  - Some nonfunctional and functional requirements  
- Moved our Living Document to the ReadMe of our GitHub repository

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Still planning to familiarize myself with SQL  
- Meeting with Shrey to discuss how SQL works and how we’ll be using it in the project

### John Harrison Polasek

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Create a wireframe for the login 
- Create a wireframe for the signup
- Start attempting to get a MySQL server from IT
#### Progress and Issues

- Attended team meeting with TA
- Completed wireframe for login page
- Completed wireframe for sign up page
- Contacted IT to get a MySQL server, currently waiting for ticket to process
#### Current Plans and Goals

- Build out front end plan (do we require users to login and sign up)
- Acquire MySQL server or adequate alternative
### Aidan Lusk

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Solidify a plan for backend development and create strict goals for the project  
- Research potential optimizations

#### Progress and Issues

- Not being able to meet enough to gain the progress I envision for the project
