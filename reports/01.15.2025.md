## Individual Contributions

### Kali Pulanco

#### Previous Plans and Goals

- Establish the functional requirements of the frontend.  
  - Figure out how to convey the information of the prompt and the input.  
  - Figure out what statistics to show the user.  
  - Figure out which requirements are more important than the others for the hierarchy of attention.

#### Progress and Issues

- Moved from a “time limit” format to a “speedrun” format for a practical setting.  
  - If we limit the user’s typing time, then the user wouldn’t learn anything. Otherwise, speedrun timers allow the user to continue to completion.  
- Added ideas for settings due to different preferences across the team when it comes to programming.

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Create a non-functional prototype of the interface for A/B testing internally to establish a design for the project.

### Shrey Bosamia

#### Previous Plans and Goals

N/A

#### Progress and Issues

- Presented project idea.  
- I had many use cases as I already had a good perception of what the project should be.  
- Led team meetings, managing the flow of what we should focus on.   
- Aided adding the project proposal to the GitHub repository with Justice and Kali.  
- We gave ourselves roles, I gave myself the role of backend and database lead since I have the most experience in that field allowing me to help other team members in that area.   
- Gave myself the role to help implement javascript functions as well.


#### Current Plans and Goals

- Work on entity relationship diagram to give a blueprint for what the database will be, also giving others a good representation of what we are going to implement.  
- Work on setting up an AWS cloud database server in case we don’t get a server from the OSU engineering department

### Justice Peyton

#### Previous Plans and Goals

N/A

#### Progress and Issues

- Created the GitHub repository and mostly set it up (with the help of Shrey and Kali).  
- Everyone was invited to the repository  
- Created the Trello board  
- Everyone was invited to the board, including CS 362 TAs and the instructor  
- I’m concerned about the trial version of Trello disabling our team’s ability to use it with more than 10 people invited, but we will see what happens– not incredibly urgent

- SQL  
- I’m concerned about the usage of SQL for our project. I have no SQL experience at all while most of the team members do have SQL experience. I’m a little worried if the project will become SQL-intensive since I lack experience, but I am willing to try to learn it.  
- Discussed with Shrey, Kali, and John about the user experience, including specific user data points that will be stored for profiles in Spryntax

#### Current Plans and Goals

- Familiarize myself with SQL
